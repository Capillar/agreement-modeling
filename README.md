# Agreement modeling repository
Using smart-contracts to implement business agreement logic

In this project , we develop a formal language that could describe the contractual relationships for civil law modeling of the contracts.
Besides, we are solving the issue of describing the formal translator of the contract model in the code of the smart contract for solidity. The examples of the semi-automatic mode translation are being accumulated.

Current results will be the basis for the formation of requirements for the smart contracts’ language that describe the contractual relations of entities.

The parallel project: development of cryptographic protocols of subjects’ information interaction, allowing determining the structure of the contract, its essential conditions, and generating a smart contract and simultaneously signing it.

The parallel project: development of parallel transactions’ interfaces in the «real world» synchronizing the changes in the smart contract state and the change in the state of economic entities that are the signatories of the smart contract.
